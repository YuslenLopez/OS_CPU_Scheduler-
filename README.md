# OS_CPU_Scheduler-
CPU Scheduling Program 

The following Code is my CPU Scheduling project for my Computer Operating Systems class where we learned about several ways the CPU can decide on which processes to run to keep the CPU busiest. In my code I implement the first come first serve (FCFS), Shortest job first (SJF) and a multilevel feedback queue(MLFQ).
